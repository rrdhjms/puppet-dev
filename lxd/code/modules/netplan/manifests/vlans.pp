# @summary validates vlan config and writes it to $config_file via concat
#
# @api private
#
# @note intended to be used only by netplan class
#
# @param renderer
#  Use the given networking backend for this definition. Currently supported are networkd and NetworkManager.
#  This property can be specified globally in networks:, for a device type (in e. g. ethernets:) or for a
#  particular device definition. Default is networkd.
# @param dhcp4
#  Enable DHCP for IPv4. Off by default.
# @param dhcp6
#  Enable DHCP for IPv6. Off by default.
# @param ipv6_privacy
#  Enable IPv6 Privacy Extensions. Off by default.
# @param link_local
#  Configure the link-local addresses to bring up. Valid options are ‘ipv4’ and ‘ipv6’.
# @param critical
#  (networkd backend only) Designate the connection as "critical to the system", meaning that special
#  care will be taken by systemd-networkd to not release the IP from DHCP when the daemon is restarted.
# @param dhcp_identifier
#  When set to ‘mac’; pass that setting over to systemd-networkd to use the device’s MAC address as a
#  unique identifier rather than a RFC4361-compliant Client ID. This has no effect when NetworkManager
#  is used as a renderer.
# @param dhcp4_overrides
#  (networkd backend only) Overrides default DHCP behavior
# @param dhcp6_overrides
#  (networkd backend only) Overrides default DHCP behavior
# @param accept_ra
#  Accept Router Advertisement that would have the kernel configure IPv6 by itself. On by default.
# @param addresses
#  Add static addresses to the interface in addition to the ones received through DHCP or RA.
#  Each sequence entry is in CIDR notation, i. e. of the form addr/prefixlen. addr is an IPv4 or IPv6
#  address as recognized by inet_pton(3) and prefixlen the number of bits of the subnet.
# @param gateway4
#  Set default gateway for IPv4, for manual address configuration. This requires setting addresses too.
# @param gateway6
#  Set default gateway for IPv6, for manual address configuration. This requires setting addresses too.
# @param nameservers
#  Set DNS servers and search domains, for manual address configuration. There are two supported fields:
#  addresses: is a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses similar to gateway*, and
#  search: is a list of search domains.
# @param macaddress
#  Set the device’s MAC address. The MAC address must be in the form "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX".
# @param mtu
#  Set the Maximum Transmission Unit for the interface. The default is 1500. Valid values depend on your network interface.
# @param optional
#  An optional device is not required for booting. Normally, networkd will wait some time for device to
#  become configured before proceeding with booting. However, if a device is marked as optional, networkd
#  will not wait for it. This is only supported by networkd, and the default is false.
# @param optional_addresses
#  Specify types of addresses that are not required for a device to be considered online.
# @param routes
#  Configure static routing for the device.
#  from: Set a source IP address for traffic going through the route.
#  to: Destination address for the route.
#  via: Address to the gateway to use for this route.
#  on-link: When set to "true", specifies that the route is directly connected to the interface.
#  metric: The relative priority of the route. Must be a positive integer value.
#  type: The type of route. Valid options are “unicast" (default), “unreachable", “blackhole" or “prohibited".
#  scope: The route scope, how wide-ranging it is to the network. Possible values are “global", “link", or “host".
#  table: The table number to use for the route.
# @param routing_policy
#  The routing-policy block defines extra routing policy for a network, where traffic may be handled specially
#  based on the source IP, firewall marking, etc.
#  For from, to, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are recognized, and must be in the form addr/prefixlen or addr
#  from: Set a source IP address to match traffic for this policy rule.
#  to: Match on traffic going to the specified destination.
#  table: The table number to match for the route.
#  priority: Specify a priority for the routing policy rule, to influence the order in which routing rules are
#    processed. A higher number means lower priority: rules are processed in order by increasing priority number.
#  mark: Have this routing policy rule match on traffic that has been marked by the iptables firewall with
#    this value. Allowed values are positive integers starting from 1.
#  type_of_service: Match this policy rule based on the type of service number applied to the traffic.
#
# @param id
#  VLAN ID, a number between 0 and 4094.
# @param link
#  netplan ID of the underlying device definition on which this VLAN gets created.
